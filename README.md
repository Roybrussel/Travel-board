# Travel Board
Project #2 of Ironhack Bootcamp

Travel Board is a platform on which a user can create a profile and add boards for the countries he or she visited. Inside the country boards, 
one can also add seperate boards for cities.

Through the discover page the user can view the boards of other users and check out their profiles.

Ideas for further development:
- User can follow and unfollow each other
- Link a location API to add a map of the country
- Link country data API to pre-load information about the visited country
